# Hackpad *Sorry, didn't have time to make it pretty, but that is an upcoming update*
--day 1 (May 31)--
I started the project, set up everything, and attended the start call! worked for about .5hrs!
--day 2 (June 2)--
I finally started to draw the skimatics and I had NO clue what I was doing, thanks to @pizzalover12.5 he guided me, and after watching a few vids and trying it on my own and running into some problems, I had it done (3hrs)
--day 3 (June 4)-- 
So I finally finished the PCB and then attended the road trip üõ£Ô∏èand almost finished the entire case, but had to stop to write this! But all all, I got pretty far!(1.5hr)
-- Day 4 (June 5) ---
I finished my case and FINALLY i just need to do the firmware now!
--end---- hours worked--- 1.2hrs ----
